Titanium_Alloy-TextToSpeech
===========================

Demonstration application showcasing the ability to use Google Translate's TTS. It is build in an Appcelerator Titanium - Alloy project, cross platform/compatible on both iOS and Android phones. 

Method used: Using an XML HTTP request, the app sends the text to Google Translate to be converted to MP3. The sound file is then grabbed and played back in the app.

Edit : Added a sample, custom-made progress bar and the code blocks to animate its completion.
